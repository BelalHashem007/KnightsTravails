# Knight travails

-A knight on a stranded 8x8 chess board.
-The goal is to make a function that takes a starting point and an end point and give the shortest path.
-Ex: knightMoves([0,0],[3,3]) returns [[0,0],[2,1],[3,3]].
-Its basic move is two steps forward and one step to the side or one step forward and two steps to the side. It can face any direction.
